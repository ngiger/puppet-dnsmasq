h1. dnsmasq module for Puppet

!https://travis-ci.org/ngiger/puppet-dnsmasq.svg?branch=master!:https://travis-ci.org/ngiger/puppet-dnsmasq is the status for our Travis-CI unit tests.

This module provides classes to manage dnmasq server.

Optionally

* it uses dnsmasq to provide TFTP-service needed for PXE.
* installs the wakeonlan packages and add all known mac/hosts-pair to /etc/ethers to allow calling @wakeonlan host@

You may choose to use either the baikal version (only bug-fixes) or the main.

h2. Examples

* To install the dnmasq server:

    @class { 'dnsmasq': }@

This sets ensure => present for the package. If you want to set a different
value, you can override the dnsmasq::params::ensure parameter using hiera.

* To install a wakeonlan and include_thinclient

bq. class {'dnsmasq':
    is_dnsmasq_server => true,
    include_wakeonlan => true,
    include_thinclient => true,
  }
      
* see the files under test for more examples

h3. Running the spec tests

bundle exec rake spec_clean spec_prep # once
bundle exec rake spec_standalone # all spec tests
bundle exec rspec spec/classes/init_spec.rb # a specific test

To find missing classes/etc I often uncomment the line @# at_exit { RSpec::Puppet::Coverage.report! }@ in spec/spec_helpers.rb
